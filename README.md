# VERIDI-LOGISTICS-AUDIT
Data analysis project on last-mile logistics performance, focusing on delivery delays, customer behavior, and order fulfillment efficiency

## A. Executive Summary

Analysis of 96,000+ delivered orders reveals that remote Northern states (RR, AM, AP) suffer 22–38% late delivery rates vs. ~5% in São Paulo. Each additional day late reduces average customer review score by approximately 0.4 points. The root cause is not operational failure but **systematic over-promising**: estimated delivery dates for remote regions are 5–7 days too optimistic relative to actual carrier performance. On-time orders average 4.18 Stars while super-late orders average 2.8 stars — a statistically significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.001). Certain product categories (office furniture, large appliances) show structurally higher late rates regardless of destination. **Recommendation:** Adjust ETA algorithms to add a +3–5 day buffer for North/Northeast regions, and renegotiate carrier SLAs in the five worst-performing states.

## C. Technical Explanation

**Data Cleaning:** Removed canceled/unavailable orders from delay analysis (tagged as "Not Delivered" rather than dropped). Deduped reviews by keeping the most recent per `order_id` to prevent row explosion on join. Filtered out null delivery dates. Used `LEFT JOIN` from the orders table throughout so no orders are silently lost. Confirmed row counts with `assert len(Master) == len(orders)` after every join.

**Sign convention note (Day_Difference):** Computed as `estimated − actual`, so positive = early arrival, negative = late. Classification (`>= 0` → On Time) is correct under this convention. The Kruskal-Wallis test confirms a statistically significant *difference in distributions* between delivery status groups — this shows strong correlation between delay and lower scores; causality should be validated with further controlled analysis.

**Candidate's Choice (DPRS):** A weighted composite score — `(1 − norm_late_rate) × 50 + (1 − norm_severity) × 30 + norm_review_score × 20` — that quantifies "promise reliability" per state on a 0–100 scale. Business value: gives regional directors a single prioritisation metric instead of three separate KPIs. A state with 10% late orders all 20 days overdue scores lower than one with 20% late orders all 1 day overdue, capturing the severity dimension the CEO cares about.

### Feature Engineering

| Feature | Formula | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `delivery_delay_days` | `estimated_date − actual_delivery_date` | Positive = early, Negative = late |
| `delivery_status` | Rule-based on `delivery_delay_days` | On Time / Late / Super Late / Not Delivered |
| `region_type` | Lookup by `customer_state` | Remote vs Core vs Other |
| `DPRS` (per state) | Weighted composite (see below) | Single KPI for promise reliability |

### Candidate's Choice — Delivery Promise Reliability Score (DPRS)

**What it is:** A composite 0–100 score computed per state, measuring how trustworthy Veridi's delivery promises are. It is calculated as:

```
DPRS = (1 − norm_late_rate)    × 50
     + (1 − norm_severity)     × 30
     + norm_avg_review_score   × 20
```

Where all components are MinMax-normalised to [0, 1] across all states.

**Why it matters to the business:**

The CEO's concern is specifically about *promise-keeping* — not just raw lateness. Two states could have identical late rates but very different customer experiences: one might have packages arriving 1 day late, the other 20 days late. DPRS captures this severity dimension. It also incorporates the customer's own perception (review score), making it a leading indicator of churn risk. Regional directors receive a single, comparable number that rolls up frequency of failure, severity of failure, and customer-perceived impact — allowing prioritised resource allocation without reading three separate reports.
